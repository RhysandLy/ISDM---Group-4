# Information System Development Methodologies - Assessment 1

## Defining the Problem
### Objectives
* Calls can be specified to RMs and improve call routing and dynamic call flow control
* Aid RMs in serving their end-customers (or potential customers)
* Match RMs and end-customers according to RMs skills and customers profiles
* Direct in bound customers to an Interactive Voice Response unit prompting them for options, and reasons for calling in a few words
* Redirect the call to an Automatic Call Distributor routing the call to the first available appropriate RM
* Improve out-bound system processes


#### Problem Statement:
##### The travel company wants to improve the operation of their in-house call management Centre (CMC) by implementing a system which will help adjust the call flow rate to suitable Relationship Managers(RM).  The customers are directed towards a voice response system during busy times, due to that customers have to wait before they are connected to the Relationship Managers(RM) and because  of that potential and more valued customers disconnect the call and not wait.Furthermore,the customers go dissatisfied with the service if they are not matched with a RM who has proper information about them.

**Problem Statement:** Business Customers 
Business customers are offered many different travel options that does not suit their needs and it becomes difficult for them 
to go through each of them as it is time consuming. It is very difficult for business customers to find the best option for 
their travelling needs. 

##### Relationship Managers

#### Relationship Managers (RM)
* HMW match RMs to callers that support thier skills and knowledge of specific travel packages?
* HMW quantify RM's skills?
* HMW find the right travel package for the required needs?

### Design Thinking Approach and Ideation Reflection
The call management centre (CMC) needs a new and improved system to assist in routing calls in an automated way, and during times of high call traffic. Our team has brainstormed ideas for efficiently routing calls with the new system. Changing from a manual system to an automated one, the system can use intelligent call routing. The customer first uses the customer profiler tool to create an account before they can call the Travel company and be matched with a Relationship Manager, the customer will then be given a unique ID that they will use to be matched with a Relationship Manager. 

When a user calls the company they are prompted by an automated message that asks for a unique ID, which is then linked to their profile in the system database and matched with a Relationship Manager that will deal with their call. If a user does not have an ID, they will be directed to an Interactive Voice Response unit prompting them questions about their reason for calling (business or leisure) and very basic information, including name, age, preferred language. From their they will be put on hold and then matched to an available corresponding Relationship Manager.

For out-bound calls from Relationship Managers, employees are given set times to carry out these calls. When they need to do out-bound calls, the system displays a target list of users that have not called the company, and relevant information to help perform a sale. The system generates a generic script and guide to help the Relationship manager.

Our team wanted to prioritise efficiency and speed with the new system. In consideration of the customers, we believe customers do not want to spend long amounts of time waiting on hold, to be met with a Relation ship manager that is not suited to their needs. The use of the automated intelligent call routing system creates a much more efficient calling environment. When considering the Relationship Managers, the customer profiler tool allows the Relationship Managers skills to be used to their full potential, by being matched with customers that they can relate to, Relationship Managers want to make as many sales as they can utilizing their skills. Rather than being general, our team decided to go with a more specialized approach for call routing.


## Agile Methodology
### Scrum

## Assumptions

* There are also travel packages to more than just holidays, customers can also purchase business packages to business trips. 
* Before customers call, they must have used the customer profile using the profiler tool.
* A target list is created with potential customers that have used the profiler tool, and have agreed to be call, sent messages etc.
* Outbound calls are performed in set times made by managers when times are quiet.
* The script and guidelines given to the relationship manager from the system to help in providing an improved service to the end-customer is only to advise, and does not have to be followed exactly
* Prior to starting the role, each RM is required to complete a questionnaire to align their knowledge with the company requirements. It is assumed that this is checked through interviews and skills testing
* Call matching is currently handled manually.
* A physical receptionist was hired to assort the inbound calls from the customers to the correct Relationship Manager through the private automatic branch exchange.
* Customer data is stored in a database with all relevant information about them that will be used to match them to a Relationship Manager.
* Managers can access the database with customer information.
* In busy times, inbound callers that stay on hold for long times if a matching relationship manager is busy, they currently redirected to the next available relationship manager.
* Our team is only dealing with the call routing system and out-bound calls, anything else is out of scope

## Advantages for developing a new Information System

Developing an information system for the in-house call management centre will provide a higher level of personalised service to customers. With being closer with the high-level support team the relationship managers can help resolve customer related issues quicker and more efficiently. Having a more personalised customer service, by routing calls from  customers to a matching relationship managers to through the system, they can build strong relationships and customers are more likely to call again and/or purchase another package and in turn improving the business’ profits. 

With the current system, callers and relationship managers are manually matched, which is an inefficient way for routing as it wastes time, potential sales and in turn costs more money. With new call routing system,  the company is given another way to improve customer experience, relationships and fosters loyalty when paired with an appropriate relationship manager quickly, as callers are pleased that the business understands their needs, interests and values their time.

The new system will be extremely scalable. Depending on future and or changing business requirements the call routing system can be scaled up or down easily. This “future-proof” design of the system is important in this ever-changing technological society where business' are always looking to upgrade and improve themselves. 

Cost effectiveness is a massive advantage when implementing a new intelligent call routing system, it can optimize operational costs by ensuring that calls are always routed to a matching relationship manager and never lost or sent to voicemail, eliminating any revenue losses that may occur due to lost calls. The improvement in call routing caller to matching relationship managers will help capitalise on conversion rates by providing a better customer experience to inbound callers. The complexities that come with manual pre-routing and computer telephony integration are eliminated with the newly defined scalable, cost-effective, customer-based information system.

With outbound calls, relationship managers are also match with customers that have shown interest in the company’s services. The information shown to the relationship managers in the database collected from the profiler tool, allows the relationship managers to make a more personal connection and target what the customer really wants. The script and guidelines given to the relationship manager from the system is a unique way to personalise the customer experience and improve relations. This will help the relationship mangers make a sale or intrigue the customer enough to call and buy a travel package. 

The new system eliminates cold calling and only relies on warm calling (The prospect has some level of interest.). This makes the companies services more personal, and more appealing to customers, that favour the respect of an individual desires. Cold calling usually ends with the customer hanging up and no sale is made.  Unsolicited calls will not help the company improve sales and profits but will most likely waste the company’s time and money. Through the new system relationship manager will only deal with customers that have shown interest and used the profiler tool and will be more likely to sell a travel package.

The new system will favour more effective and personal inbound and outbound calling strategies, thus improving sales and customer relationships.
